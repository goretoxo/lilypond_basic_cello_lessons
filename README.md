## Lilypond basic cello lessons transcriptions

- Working repo for cello learning lessons, from different sources.
- the objective is having some lilypond pages with all the stuff a novice player uses
- and some practice on writting lilypond files

- there's a [abc2ly](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/usage/invoking-abc2ly), to convert ABC files into lilypond (one song per ABC file)

- with the inclusion of pdftk magic, this is an example of "complound books" for educational purposes
